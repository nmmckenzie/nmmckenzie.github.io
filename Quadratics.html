        <h2>Quadratics Model Projectiles</h2>
        <p>If we throw a ball and want to predict the maximum height achieved, total distance traveled and even how long it would take to reach a certain height or horizontal distance, we can do that! Projectiles follow the path of a parabola, and quadratic
          equations describe the shape of a parabola. Yep, when you’re playing catch you’re doing a great deal of math and physics without even thinking!

          <h3>Form and Function</h3>
          <p> The quadratic equation is most commonly represented in the forms below, and for all three:</p>
          <div id="mathtable">

          <h3>Forms of the Function</h3>
          <p> The quadratic equation is commonly written or represented in three ways, each of which makes certain features of the curve easier to determine:</p>

        <summary><h3>FOIL</h3></summary>
     
          <p>FOILing is a useful tool for moving between equivalent forms of the quadratic function. While I think of FOIL as my path between all three, some students like to think of FOIL as expanding the factored form to get standard form and use Reverse
            FOIL to go from standard to factored.
          </p>
          <p>Well after all that, what is FOIL? It stands for multiplying the terms in the order First, Outside, Inside, Last.</p>
          <div class="foil">

        <summary><h3>Roots</h3></summary>
          
          <p>Zeroes, solutions, or roots of a quadratic function are those values of x that result in 0 for y. The co-ordinates of REAL roots take the form (x,0), so these would fall on the x-axis.</p>

          <h3>Find Roots using the Quadratic Formula</h3>
          <p>When written in the standard format the quadratic function may be solved using the quadratic formula. The factored or completed square versions may be reduced to the quadratic formula by multiplying and simplifying. The quadratic formula, to
            find the values of x that make y=0 is: </p>

        <summary>Testimonials</summary>
        <p> Llama is amazing! I was so nervous, but Llama helped me bring up my math score enough to qualify for an Alpaca Merit Zappified National (AMZN) Scholarship! <b> Anonymous </b></p>
        <p> All my friends and I really hated math until Llama showed us that it's not that bad. We don't love math or anything, but at least we understand what's going on in class now. We were even able to explain this new principle called people points
          that no one else gets!!! <b> Des Cartes</b></p>
        <p> Llama math is not just for kids! I work in retail and Llama convinced me that I had to cut prices as it would improve my profits. How? Well, lower prices will increase the number of customers who are able to buy my products! Or something! <b> Merchand </b>          </p>
