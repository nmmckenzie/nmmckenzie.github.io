        <h2> Linear Relationships</h2>
        <p>Many relationships are approximately linear. If we graph the effect that the independent variable (the one I know/have/start with) has on the dependent variable (the one that changes as a result of changes in the independent variable), we put
          the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis.

          <h3>Form and Function</h3> Lines are most commonly represented in the form y=mx+b
          <p>x: independent variable</p>
          <p>y: dependent variable</p>
          <p>m: slope</p>
          <p>b: intercept</p>
          <h3>Slope and Intercept</h3> 
		  <p>The slope (m) is the slant or rate of change. It represents how much y will change if x is increase by 1. If m &gt; 0, the line goes up and to the right. If 
		  m &lt; 0, the line goes down and to the left. The intercept (b), is how much of y we have when
            x=0. Itâ€™s actually where the line cuts the y-axis, and is given by the point (0,b). </p>

        <summary><h3>Draw Lines!</h3></summary>
             <p>Enter integer values between -10 and 10 for the slope and/or the intercept to draw your own line.</p>
            <p>The values are configured to draw: y=x+1 (m=1 and b=1).</p>

        <p> Llama is amazing! I was so nervous, but Llama helped me bring up my math score enough to qualify for an Alpaca Merit Zappified National (AMZN) Scholarship! <b> Anonymous </b></p>
        <p> All my friends and I really hated math until Llama showed us that it's not that bad. We don't love math or anything, but at least we understand what's going on in class now. We were even able to explain this new principle called people points
          that no one else gets!!! <b> Des Cartes</b></p>
        <p> Llama math is not just for kids! I work in retail and Llama convinced me that I had to cut prices as it would improve my profits. How? Well, lower prices will increase the number of customers who are able to buy my products! Or something! <b> Merchand </b>          </p>
